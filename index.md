Welcome! Iâ€™m **Guan Huang**, a Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Software Engineering at **Auburn University**.

My research focuses on **federated learning**, **transformer-based models**, **graph neural networks**, and **optimization for large language models (LLMs)**. I aim to make machine learning more efficient, robust, and applicable to real-world domains, including noisy label learning, cybersecurity, and satellite systems.

Iâ€™ve published in top venues such as **ICML** and **ICMLA**, and Iâ€™m supported by the **Auburn University Graduate Research Fellowship** and an **NSF-funded project** through my advisor.
